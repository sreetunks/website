    <p>There&rsquo;s no one to blame here but you. I know this. You know this. Blur knows this. Why&rsquo;d you do it?</p>
<p>So you have a Design Dillemma. Maybe you&rsquo;re creating new characters for an old, forgotten game and you don&rsquo;t have friends who play this game. Maybe you like Melee combat in Video Games but you can&rsquo;t find like-minded individuals to share this interest with and delve into the cling-clang in their screens. Or maybe you&rsquo;re just stupid.
Speaking of stupid, you have what you think, falsely (oh so very falsely), is a very bright idea. Perhaps the brightest of your generation. You decide to ask Blur for design advice. Now, I&rsquo;m not gonna put you on the spot but you&rsquo;re here reading this because you asked Blur and you now know the result.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try and salvage this, shall we?</p>
<h1 id="why-it-doesnt-work">
  Why it doesn&rsquo;t work
</h1>
<hr>
<p>Because the man is a mere shadow. He doesn&rsquo;t have opinions or views on the world. He doesn&rsquo;t care what your design constraints are. He&rsquo;s rolling in the perfectly normal Mobile Game Platform dough and to him, all your silly issues look no more deserving of his attention than any other insect on this planet.
The man is built differently. Do not forget this. Ever again.</p>
<h1 id="who-you-can-ask-instead">
  Who you can ask instead
</h1>
<hr>
<p>Everyone, other than me and Blur, makes mistakes. But what&rsquo;s important is that you let me know about these mistakes so I can make a blog post instructing you on what further course of action is most suitable. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You are here.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Now, some might say you&rsquo;re being overbearing, but you still have that design problem of yours that you&rsquo;ve not recieved a solution for. God forbid you think through that one yourself. Let&rsquo;s see what other overflowing vessels of knowledge you should consult instead of bothering Blur with your mortal matters.
* BlazeDeAssassin: He&rsquo;s got nothing to do right now. He plays too much Overwatch. Give the guy a purpose in life. But you try and give him anything more, you&rsquo;ll be answering to me.
* EyeEyeMan: Eh. Don&rsquo;t do it actually. Man&rsquo;s probably just going to drag you into a long-winded arguement. In addition, his sociability is severely lacking even given proximity to a true man of the people such as myself.
* Reve uwu: &gt;Shutthefuggup!Shutthefuggup! Time isn&rsquo;t real. One Sec.</p>
<h1 id="well-that-didnt-work-either-did-it">
  Well, that didn&rsquo;t work either, did it?
</h1>
<hr>
<p>At this point, you probably have naysayers saying real dumb stuff like, &ldquo;You could probably work that out yourself.&rdquo;. Haha. Real funny ones, aren&rsquo;t they. Maybe they should go on LinkedIn so that they&rsquo;re not taken seriously anymore.
In this end of ends, might I offer you some quality discussion on various Game Design topics by 3 bumbling idiots and myself. You can watch them stumble around trying make sense of the grandeur that is my consciousness. And maybe you get a little info out of that exchange too. Look at you all smart and stuff.
Reserve any disgust you have at the inclusion of promotional content into this regular stream of knowledge. You asked Blur. Your opinion is just objectively wrong. You don&rsquo;t get to judge anything.
<a href="https://www.anchor.fm/gamedevpodcast">This</a> should answer all your questions. If not, wait a week. The next episode probably will. No need to thank me. And certainly no need to thank Blur.</p>
