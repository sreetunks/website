# About me
---

My name is Sreenath but on the internet I mostly go by `sreetunks` or a derivative of it. I was trained as a Game Designer with a focus on Project Management and Game Production Management and I'm a self-taught programmer. I've worked in student teams fulfilling the roles of Game Designer, Programmer and Project Manager and I've previously worked as a Junior Games Programmer at <b>[Photon Tadpole Studios](https://photontadpole.com)</b>, Mumbai, India mainly dealing with Games targeting the Android and iOS platforms using the Unity Game Engine. I'm currently completing a CS Bachelor's Degree as part of the Game Development Program at [Full Sail University](https://fullsail.edu). I've worked with proprietary engines like Unity, Unreal Engine 4 and also with Frameworks like SDL and MonoGame.<br>
My current professional focus is on low-level development using mostly C, working directly with Platform Layers like the Android NDK and the Win32 API while also working on making a full-fledged Game Engine from scratch to serve as a launch pad to future projects.
I'm also focused on exploring Game Systems that are more than simple competition/co-operation games. As a note, Games are strictly multiplayer and are not a Narrative medium. Any story inferred is simply a side-effect of Gameplay which is the focus of all games. Might as well get that out the way here.<br>
This website will serve as a journal to my work, both professional and hobbyist. While I have provided my contact information on this page, I am not actively seeking discourse of any kind and recommend that they be used only for *serious* matters.
